# Week 01 Assignment: Epileptic Seizure Data Preparation

## Overview
As a Data Scientist, you often have lots of data at your disposal. Unfortunately, data from real-life cases is often not nicely structured. We need to manipulate the unstructured and/or messy data into a structured or clean form.

## Data Preparation
Data preparation involves several key steps:
- **Dropping unnecessary rows and columns**: Some data points might not be needed for analysis, or they may contain too many missing values.
- **Relabeling columns**: Ensuring column names are meaningful and correctly formatted.
- **Reformatting characters into numerical values**: Converting categorical or text data into numerical representations.
- **Combining data from multiple sources**: Merging datasets to enrich the available information.

`**Cleaning and manipulating data into a structured form is crucial for effective analysis and modeling.**`

- **Data wrangling** with pandas, NumPy, yaml.
- **Data visualization** matplotlib, Bokeh.
- **Preprocessing EEG (electroencephalogram) data** into an appropriate format for statistical and visual analysis.
